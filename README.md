Changing Json Data With Using Php

# Coded For
my friend's( <a href="https://github.com/iawoken">@iawoken</a> ) school project. It was pulling fan data with json via Arduino. He asked me for a panel where he could change the fan data over the web. So I did it on a simple level and gave it to him. It took about 3 hours.

# Purpose
It changes the data ( json file ) you have changed on the index.php file when you press the save button.
